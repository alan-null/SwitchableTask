# Switchable Sitecore Schedule task
 
## Why?
Sitecore schedule tasks allows you to define schedule time with `schedule` field. 
There is no simple way to just disable/enable tasks later without touching this field.

This small module improves schedule tasks by adding additional **on/off** checkbox to it.
